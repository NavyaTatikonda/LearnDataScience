# This is the structure of the meetup series 
|Meetup  | Title      | Description|
|--------|------------|------------|
|1| **Intro to Data Science** | Applications of Data Science, Tools and Flow |
|2| **Gradient Descent and related algorithms.** |Using the assignments that we have provided in Meetup 1, we have to explain gradient descent, and possibly the other such algorithms. The assignment for this meetup will be considering a loss function and randomly initiated the weights and plotting the loss using python.|
|3| **Regression Techniques.** |We'll include Linear and Logistic Regression in this session.|
|4| **Tree-based and Bagging Algorithms.** |Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc|
|5| **Boosting Techniques.** |XGBoost, LightGBM, etc|
|6| **Intro to Neural Nets.** |We'll start from linear and logistic regression and complicate it a little to explain Deep Neural Nets. If possible we can explain CNNs and RNNs as well.|
