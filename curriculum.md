# This is our recommended Data Science curriculum
|Meetup  | Title  | Description|
|--------|--------|------------|
|Meetup 1| **Basics of linear Algebra and Python.** |We will be explaining the basics of python and algebra, that are sufficient for the coming 5 meetups, and give them assignments to work on.|
|Meetup 2| **Gradient Descent and related algorithms.** |Using the assignments that we have provided in Meetup 1, we have to explain gradient descent, and possibly the other such algorithms. The assignment for this meetup will be considering a loss function and randomly initiated the weights and plotting the loss using python.|
|Meetup 3| **Regression Techniques.** |We'll include Linear and Logistic Regression in this session.|
|Meetup 4| **Tree-based and Bagging Algorithms.** |Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc|
|Meetup 5| **Boosting Techniques.** |XGBoost, LightGBM, etc|
|Meetup 6| **Intro to Neural Nets.** |We'll start from linear and logistic regression and complicate it a little to explain Deep Neural Nets. If possible we can explain CNNs and RNNs as well.|
